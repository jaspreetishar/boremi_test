## Quick Start Guide: Setting up BoReMi on a Cluster or a Local Environment

1. Notebooks: To set up BoReMi, two notebooks are provided in the `BoReMi directory` on the repository's main page: `GUI.ipynb` and `Functions.ipynb`.
   - `GUI.ipynb` serves as a graphical user interface.
   - `Functions.ipynb` contains all the necessary functions.
  
2. Obtaining the notebooks: There are two methods to obtain the notebooks.
   - Direct Download: Click on "Code" at the upper right corner of this repository and select "Download ZIP". Move the downloaded .zip file to the desired directory on your local machine/cluster and unpack it.
   - Git Clone: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/jaspreetishar/BoReMi.git` to clone the repository and extract the notebooks onto your local machine/cluster.

3. Required Libraries/Packages/Extensions: Ensure you install the necessary libraries, packages, and extensions specified in the `requirements.txt` file located on the repository's main page using the following guidelines.

   - Navigate to the Project Directory
     - First, navigate to the root directory of the project. For example:
      
        ```bash
        cd path/to/BoReMi
        ```
        
        *Replace `path/to/BoReMi` with the actual path to the cloned repository.*
     
   - Create a New Virtual Environment
     - To avoid conflicts with existing versions of the required libraries/packages/extensions, it is recommended to create a new virtual environment. For instance, you can use Conda to create this environment:

       ```bash
       conda create --name boremi_env python=3.11.5
       conda activate boremi_env
       ```
     
   - Install Dependencies in the Virtual Environment
     - Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
     
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

   - Install Jupyter Lab and Connect the IPython Kernel
     - Install Jupyter Lab and set up the IPython kernel for your virtual environment:

        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab=3.6.3
        python -m ipykernel install --user --name=boremi_env
        ```

       *This will allow you to select the boremi_env kernel when running Jupyter Lab.*
  
   - Update Regularly
     - Periodically check for updates to the `requirements.txt` file and update your virtual environment accordingly to stay compatible with the latest features and fixes:

       ```bash
       pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
       ```

   #### *By following these steps, you will ensure that BoReMi runs smoothly without any library conflicts, improving user experience.*
       
5. Accessing the GUI: To use BoReMi, open the `GUI.ipynb` file by typing the following in the terminal or an Anaconda command prompt:
   
   ```bash
   jupyter-lab path/to/BoReMi/BoReMi/GUI.ipynb
   ```
   *Replace `path/to/BoReMi/BoReMi/GUI.ipynb` with the actual path to the `GUI.ipynb` file present in the `BoReMi directory` of the cloned repository.*

6. BoReMi Usage: Follow the provided guidelines and instructions inside `GUI.ipynb`. Begin using the tool and explore its functionalities.

7. Exit: To exit the virtual environment, type the following in the terminal or an Anaconda command prompt:
   
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```
